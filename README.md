# Getting started

Full installation guide for most users with requirements was described in [Standard installation](INSTALLATION.md#standard-installation).

There are three ways to deploy LearnIn:
* [production](INSTALLATION.md#standard-installation) - for most users, prepared to deploy on your web server, 
* [development](INSTALLATION.md#development-environment) - for feature development,
* [docker](INSTALLATION.md#docker-development) - docker environment.

# Configuration

You can configure the project by your own needs.
To do this, open .env file (cloned from .env.dev or .env.prod or .env.docker) and change parameters.

1. [Database credentials](INSTALLATION.md#database)

2. [Project directory](INSTALLATION.md#project-location)

3. [Localization - language](INSTALLATION.md#localization)

4. [Apache configuration - optional](INSTALLATION.md#apacheconf)

5. [NGINX configuration - optional](INSTALLATION.md#nginxconf)
   
6. It's highly recommend to run the scheduler (that cleans old generated .zip files by teachers every 3 hours):

**In Docker:**
```
docker exec -it app sh -c "php /var/www/html/artisan schedule:work"
```

**Locally:**
```
php artisan schedule:work
```
